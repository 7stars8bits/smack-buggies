# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently only provide security updates for the most recent "Stable" or "Beta" releases.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a potential security risk (such as a way to crash servers, exploit client data, or bypass authentication), we want to fix it before it's widely known.

### How to Report
1. **Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Please use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature directly on this repository's "Security" tab.
2. **Alternative:** If that is unavailable, please open a private discussion or contact the maintainer directly via GitHub profile details.

### What to Expect
* **Acknowledgement:** You will receive a response acknowledging your report within **one week**.
* **Updates:** For ongoing investigations, we will provide status updates **once a month** until the issue is resolved.
* **Disclosure:** Once a fix is deployed, we will coordinate with you to publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit your discovery (if desired).

Thank you for helping keep the Smack-Buggies community safe!
